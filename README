NAME
    Class::DBI::Loader::Kinship - Fixes to Class::DBI::Loader

SYNOPSIS
      use Class::DBI::Loader::Kinship;

      my $l = new Class::DBI::Loader::Kinship  (
                    dsn           =>  $ENV{ DBI_DSN  },
                    user          =>  $ENV{ DBI_USER },
                    password      =>  $ENV{ DBI_PASS },
                    namespace     =>  'music',
                    exclude       =>  '^pg_.*|sql_.*',
      );

      my @tables  = $l->tables;
      my @classes = $l->classes;

      print Dumper $l->kinships;
      print Dumper $l->kinships('music::Cd');
      print Dumper $l->kinships('music::Cd', 'has_a');
      print Dumper $l->kinships('music::Cd', 'has_many');

DESCRIPTION
    A subclass of Class::DBI::Loader which introduces the 3rd argument to
    has_many relations, adds support to schemas for Postgresql, and provides
    a few additional fuctions. This package still dependends on its
    subclass; and so far, I resisted to opt for cleaner code and fork my own
    direction. The original Pg subclass is intentionally prevented from
    loading so another can masquerade in its palace.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

SEE ALSO
    Class::DBI::Loader, Class::DBI::Loader::Pg.
